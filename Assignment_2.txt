1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ANS: True & False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans:  and , or , not
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ans:  

x=[True, False]
y=[True, False]

for i in x:
    for j in y:
        print (i,'and',j, '=', i and j)
        print (i,'or',j, '=', i or j)
    print('not',i, '=',not i)



4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)- False
not (5 > 4)- false
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) - True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))- False
(True and True) and (True == False) - False
(not False) or (not True)-  True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
equal to, not equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to. 
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans: 
a=5 #assign
if a==5: #checking condition

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0 #assign
if spam == 10 # need :
print('eggs') # need indentation
if spam > 5:
print('bacon') # need indentation
else:
print('ham') # need indentation
print('spam')
print('spam')
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam=int(input())
if spam==1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam==2:
        print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greentings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
A: press kernel in jupyter notebook & interrupt program

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A: break- it breaks the current loop
continue- it skips the current iteration

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A: all are same
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)

i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i)
    i=i+1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
